Parts
=====


I purchased parts on DigiKey per the [ergodox.org]( http://ergodox.org ) list, which I'll reproduce here since that site is currently offline

I would recommend substituting surface mount parts for the THT diodes. They're easier to solder and trim and will result in a cleaner final product with wider mechanical clearances. Unfortunately the mini-USB connecter often goes out of stock, so be aware that it may not be available.

I chose to use Gateron Brown switches. They seem widely regarded as a better quality clone of the gold standard Cherry MX brand and have a [light, tactile throw](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/mechanical-keyboard-guide#best) without being clicky.

Note that a standard, stereo audio cable isn't enough to connect the two sides. You need a four conductor TRRS cable (the extra aRRRR is for tip-ring-ring-sleeve) to carry GND, +5, and I²C SDA/SCL.

There are a couple standard keycap profiles. DSA is convenient because keys are [interchangable]( http://pimpmykeyboard.com/key-cap-family-specs/) between rows. This was especially desirable because I planned to use the [Colemak]( http://chetansurpur.com/blog/2012/11/colemak.html ) layout, for which profiled keycaps would be hard to find

Case
====

I pulled what appear to be Litster's original .DXF files from [bishboria's github]( https://github.com/bishboria/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDox%20Acrylic%20Case ) and exported them to SVG using Inkscape.

![ponoko panel](/images/ergodox/ponoko.png)

I had the acrylic cut at [Ponoko]( https://www.ponoko.com/ ). Unfortunately I made a mistake scaling one of the spacer layers in the process of tiling the SVGs onto a single panel, so I had to substitute some washers for L3-Left until I get access to a bandsaw or a 3D printer.

The SVGs are up on [my github]( https://github.com/fkoran/ergodox-acrylic-svg ).

![stack of acrylic](/images/ergodox/layer_all_left.jpg)

These are the layer thicknesses I used. The Gateron switches fit perfectly with 4.5mm acrylic on layer 3. Be sure if you're using THT diodes to use a material for layer 4 that's a bit thicker than 4.5mm.
- Layer 1 (top) - 3mm
- Layer 2 (spacer) - 4.5mm
- Layer 3 (switch plate) - 4.5mm
- Layer 4 (spacer) - 4.5mm
- Layer 5 (bottom) - 3mm



Assembly Instructions
=====================

I used the [Massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/assembly.php) assembly instructions as a reference. If this is your first soldering project it's worth flipping through the fantastic guide [Soldering is Easy (8 page pdf)]( https://mightyohm.com/files/soldercomic/FullSolderComic_EN.pdf )

![filler image of various parts](/images/ergodox/parts_pcb_acrylic_keys_caps.jpg)

Tools
-----

![tools](/images/ergodox/null.jpg)

- A digitally temperature regulated soldering iron - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cAUvrr ) (there are cheaper analog or non-regulated stations available, but it's much more difficult to get consistent results)
- A tube of solder - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cAXe47 )
- Tweezers - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cAV9Wb )
- A magnifier and helping hand - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cAUfJ2 ) (a [multi-purpose hobby vise]( http://amzn.to/2cAUzHW) isn't necessary, but it sure is nice)
- 20-30 gauge wire stripping tool - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cAV84l )
- Flush cut wire trimmers - [amazon]( http://amzn.to/2cATtvy )


For THT diodes
--------------

Bend each diode into a U shape and populate the marked spaces below each of the keyswitch sockets

![stuffed diodes](/images/ergodox/assembly_diodes_sharp_side.jpg)

Confirm that each diode is oriented so that the cathode, marked with a black ring, is closer to the square solder pad

![diode orientation](/images/ergodox/assembly_diodes_magnified.jpg)

Clip the leads with a pair of flush cut trimmers and press the diode bodies flat against the PCB

![clipping](/images/ergodox/assembly_diode_clip.jpg)

![clipped and mashed diodes](/images/ergodox/null.jpg)

For SMT diodes
--------------

Solder a diode below each of the keyswitch sockets. Confirm that each diode is oriented so that the cathode, marked with a white line, is closer to the square solder pad

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/polarity/diode-and-led-polarity

Resistors
---------

The resistors are color coded. (relevant [xkcd]( https://xkcd.com/227/ ))

![2.2kohm w/ labels](/images/ergodox/parts_resistor_2_2k.jpg)
![220ohm w/ labels](/images/ergodox/parts_resistor_220ohm.jpg)

TRRS Connector (3.5mm audio jack)
----------------------------------

Populate the jumpers as shown. These are needed to reuse the same PCB for reused right and left hands

![TRRS and jumpers back to back](/images/ergodox/assembly_trrs_jumpers_stuffed.jpg)

IO Expander
-----------

Populate the IO expander DIP as shown

![io expander populated](/images/ergodox/assembly_mcu_cap.jpg)

Teensy
------

Cut and strip the spare USB mini-B cable to bridge from the PCB to the Teensy

![usb.gif](/images/ergodox/assembly_usb_cut_alt.gif)

Plug the 12 pin inline headers into the right hand PCB and stack the Teesny 2.0 on top of them. Tack down two pins on opposing corners to hold the assembly in place before soldering the rest

![complete but for the switches](/images/ergodox/assembly_complete_minus_keys.jpg)

Keyswitches
----------

Plug the keyswitches into the layer 3 support plate. Place the support plate switch-side down on a table and align the PCB with the switch pins. Solder the switches down while the support plate is sandwiched between the keyswitches and the PCB.

![switches in plate](/images/ergodox/assembly_switches_alt.jpg)

Troubleshooting
---------------

The left side of the keyboard worked perfectly on the first try. As soon as I plugged in the right side my laptop started opening the Win+X menu. 

I rebuilt the [firmware]( https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware ) to generate a 'z' from what had been the windows key and got a spray of "bzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvb"

![screenshot of passmark keytest](/images/ergodox/troubleshoot_keytest.png)

After a quick visual inspection to verify that the diodes were all oriented correctly, I brought up the [schematic]( https://github.com/bishboria/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDOX%20pcb )

![schematic highlighting the ROW2 net](/images/ergodox/troubleshoot_schematic.png)

When the firmware performs a scan it pulls each column low in turn. While a given column is low it checks each row to see if a closed switch is connecting the two. Komar has a good overview of this on his [site](http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/). All the affected keys were on the ROW2 net.

Since each row net surfaces only at the IO expander and at the switches of that row, I had only to check for solder bridges at those points. I found a solder bridge between a switch contact and a mounting hole. The mounting hole didn't have any external cladding but on inspection with a meter, I found that the solder bridge was shorting directly to the ground plane.

Conclusion
==========

I didn't wind up using this thing. I have a Surface Pro 4 and the difference between that and an ergodox is too big to traverse on a daily basis. It was still a fun project.

{::comment}
on plugging in the left side, the keyboard behaved funny, opening the win
+x menu
I edited the firmware to generate a 'z' from what had been the windows key and got a spray of "bzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvbzzxcvb"
I installed the keyboard test sw from passmark and confirmed that all keys on the bottom row were held down. Those keys retain the same position in colemak.
visually it appears there might be a solder bridge on one of these keys, but it's between two vias that are shorted anyway
there isn't an easy way for relevant pins to short
was a diode installed backwards? check tomorrow

after a quick visual inspection to verify that the diodes were all installe correctly, i bruoght up th schematic

when the firmware performs a scan, it pulls each collumn low in turn, and checks each row to see if a switch is closed to connec the two

since one row is always activve, at seems like one row is being held low

this is easy, since each row line is connecte only to the input pin an the switches of that row, surfacing only at the switch holes

there was a solder bridge from a switch contact to a m
ounting hole. the mounting hole didn't have any visible cladding, but on probing with a meter, the sides of the hole are connected to ground

iven how close these holes are and how poor many of our soldering skills are, I think it's likely that this kind of bridging is at fault for many stuck rows. [check the forums to see if this is the case?]
