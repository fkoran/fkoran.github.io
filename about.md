I'm passionate about working across layers of the hardware and software stack to solve problems and bring the best quality product to market.

Who I am
--------

After receiving my engineering degree I spent 4 years at Intel developing SoC firmware, including driver and feature development, debug, and working with hardware designers to resolve ambiguities in the hardware specifications and translate low level hardware controls into an effective firmware architecture. I worked on the board support packages for the Medfield, Merrifield, and Clovertrail SoC platforms.

I have hands-on experience with board and silicon bring-up, feature validation, debug with digital and RF test equipment, and direct support with international customers. In my free time I've been working on a 3d-printed force sensitive multiaxis input device using OpenSCAD and the ATMEGA32U4.
