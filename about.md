# Who I am

After receiving my engineering degree I spent 4 years at Intel developing SoC firmware, including driver and feature development, debug, and working with hardware designers to resolve ambiguities in the hardware specifications and translate low level hardware controls into an effective firmware architecture. I worked on the board support packages for the Medfield, Merrifield, and Clovertrail SoC platforms.

I have hands-on experience with board and silicon bring-up, feature validation, debug with digital and RF test equipment, and direct support with international customers. In my free time I've been working on a project to bring a serial command set and speed-oriented control to off-the-shelf brushless ESCs.
